## Pipeline Setup

Setting up the pipeline must be completed by someone who has the appropriate credentials for doing so. In order to do so you must obtain the appropriate credentials for your git repo (if its not GitHub), the Concourse CI server, and a Docker Hub (online or internal) V2 account. Ensure that you have these credentials before trying to set up the Concourse CI pipeline for your project.
